In this program we are creating a To-Do list.

Within the program We can add an item to the list as an incomplete task and further add to the list, tracking which items are incomplete.
Once an item is complete, we mark the item as complete, giving us the ability to process tasks through our To-Do list program.
We can view our To-Do items as a list and conversely we can also view a list of completed items. If we wish, we can also delete items. We can also select quit to quit the application.

The user is guided by a prompt via the command line to select options throughout a menu by entering a number corresponding to the option you want to select.
